Since October 2018 Lodi and Nick are co-owners of CO2ok. They have a commercial background and wanted to start their own business. They also wanted to use their knowledge for the environment. When they heard about CO2ok they were instantly enthusiastic. They phoned Milo and soon their collaboration was a fact. Milo is responsible for the ideas and the technology and Lodi and Nick for the operational management. Their dream?

In Kortom, de Ninja-app downloadt de lijst met partnerwinkels en werkt vervolgens in de achtergrond, door de website die u bekijkt te vergelijken met de gedownloade lijst, en als er is een overeenkomst, het toont onze CO₂ok-knop. De informatie over bezocht websites verlaat uw computer niet, dus uw privacy is beschermd. De Ninja-app heeft een open code beschikbaar bij Github, zodat iedereen het kan bekijken en controleren om er zeker van te zijn dat het het is veilig in gebruik.","faq2_title":"Volgt de Ninja-app mijn aankopen of internetactiviteit?","faq2_text":"Nee! We hebben uw gegevens niet nodig om de klimaatverandering te bestrijden en daarom verzamelen of bewaren wij geen persoonlijke winkelgegevens. Ons doel is om de wereld een betere plek te maken en geen gegevens te verzamelen. We krijgen wel informatie over wat voor soort producten worden gekocht en hoeveel items elke maand worden gekocht, maar we houden geen rekening met de aankopen van individuele gebruikers en slaan deze niet op!","faq3_title":"In welke winkels werkt de Ninja-app?","faq3_text":"We zijn een partnerschap aangegaan met verschillende grote e-commercebedrijven zoals Ebay, Bol.com, Booking.com, CoolBlue, AliExpress, Etsy en meer dan 22.000 anderen. Bekijk de lijst met alle deelnemende winkels.","faq4_title":"Hoe profiteren winkels van het CO₂ok Ninja-programma?","faq4_text":"Onze gebruikers zijn klanten die een sterke prikkel hebben om te kopen bij onze partnerwinkels en niet bij hun concurrenten.<br><br>We bereiden meerdere nieuwe functies voor, zoals het markeren van de websites van partners in de zoekresultaten. Deze functies drijven nieuwe consumenten rechtstreeks naar de winkels van partners. <br><br>Dankzij CO₂ok worden de merken van de winkels geassocieerd met een groot doel. Ze laten zien dat het klimaat en onze omgeving ook voor hen van belang zijn en daarmee vergroten ze hun imago.","faq5_title":"Hoe groot is jouw stuk van de taart?","faq5_text":"We investeren 75% van de commissie in de CO₂-vergoeding. De overige 25% is hard nodig om CO₂ok aan de gang te houden. We zijn net begonnen en onze marge dekt niet eens de kosten. Ons doel is om impact te maken en iedereen de kans te bieden om gemakkelijk de klimaatverandering te bestrijden. Uiteindelijk zullen we onze marge verminderen - we zijn niet in deze om rijk te worden. We zullen altijd open en transparant zijn en daarom zullen we elk jaar onze inkomsten en uitgaven rapporteren.","faq6_title":"Ik shop alleen bij Amazon en gebruik al het Amazon Smile-programma. Kan ik de Ninja-app installeren?","faq6_text":"Ten eerste doneren onze partners meestal 2-12 keer meer via de Ninja-app (1-6%) dan Amazon via Amazon Smile (slechts 0,5% van de uiteindelijke prijs). Dus, als je een zo groot mogelijke positieve invloed op de wereld wilt hebben, is het gebruik van de Ninja-app in plaats van of in aanvulling op Amazon Smile een manier om dat te bereiken. Bovendien zijn er veel producten of services beschikbaar in onze partnerwinkels die niet beschikbaar zijn op Amazon. Bijvoorbeeld reisdiensten (hotels, vluchten, treinkaartjes, autoverhuur), financiële producten of officiële kleding van sportclubs.","faq7_title":"Credits voor Altruisto","faq7_text":"We willen Altruisto bedanken voor het open source plaatsen van hun code zodat we ons eigen project kunnen aanvatten op basis van hun eerdere werk. Altruisto doet geweldig werk door te doneren aan goede doelen via online winkelen. Hun GitHub-repo is hier te vinden: de Altruisto GitHub-repository","faq8_title":"Kost het me iets om de Ninja-app te gebruiken?","faq8_text":"Nee, de Ninja-app is absoluut gratis te gebruiken. De prijzen in de online winkels zijn exact hetzelfde, of u de app nu gebruikt of niet.","faq9_title":"Ik koop geen van deze winkels, is er een reden voor mij om de Ninja-app te installeren?","faq9_text":"Ja, er zijn drie redenen: <br>1) We werken voortdurend aan nieuwe partnerschappen, dus we kunnen samenwerken met winkels die u in de nabije toekomst wel gebruikt. Het is eenvoudiger om het al te installeren in plaats van regelmatig te controleren of winkels die u gebruikt, zijn toegevoegd. <br> 2) Als u ooit eens besluit om bij onze partners te kopen, kan het hebben van de Ninja App al een verschil maken met de uitvoer van CO₂ in de wereld. Het is beter om het te hebben geïnstalleerd voor het geval dat, in plaats van een gemakkelijke kans te missen om heel veel gratis te doen. <br> 3) Het is gemakkelijker om nieuwe partnerschappen tot stand te brengen met een groter gebruikersbestand: hoe meer gebruikers de Ninja-app heeft, hoe gemakkelijker het is om nieuwe winkels te overtuigen om deel te nemen aan ons initiatief. Daarom, door de Ninja-app te installeren, maakt u het waarschijnlijker dat we zullen samenwerken met winkels die u in de toekomst gebruikt.","faq10_title":"Hoe werkt het?","faq10_text":"Na het installeren van de Ninja-app ziet u een onze \"Shop CO₂ok\" -doos terwijl u winkelt in een van onze partnerwinkels. Klik eenvoudigweg op dit vakje en u wordt teruggeleid naar de partnerwinkel (precies waar u eerder was). Vanaf dat moment ontvangt CO₂ok, wanneer u iets koopt, een deel van de prijs die u betaalt (meestal tussen 1% en 6%). We doneren onze winst aan zorgvuldig geselecteerde organisaties zoals Atmosfair. In sommige winkels moet u het proces na enige tijd herhalen. Je bent een mobiele Ninja - zie hier.","faq11_title":"Hoe weet ik zeker dat het geld zal worden gebruikt om broeikasgassen te compenseren?","faq11_text":"Atmosfair en Fair Climate Fund verschaffen ons certificaten om te bewijzen dat we hebben gecompenseerd.

Als de fabrikanten deze gegevens niet kennen of rapporteren, zullen we deze schatten, waardoor onze nauwkeurigheid geleidelijk verbetert. <a class=\"link\" href=\"#\"> (details) </a>","faq15_title":"Gaat mijn hele bijdrage naar CO2-compensatie?","faq15_text":"Aanvankelijk gaat 75% van uw bijdrage naar CO2-compensatie via Atmosfair. Onze marge van 25% zal worden gebruikt om CO₂ok duurzaam te maken en ervoor te zorgen dat alle online winkels onze plug-in gebruiken om CO2-compensatie te bieden. Uiteindelijk zullen we onze marge verminderen - we zijn niet in deze om rijk te worden. We rapporteren elk jaar onze inkomsten en uitgaven.","faq16_title":"Wat voor soort projecten zullen we financieren?","faq16_text":"Naast projecten op het gebied van hernieuwbare energie, zoals zonne-, wind- en waterkracht, zullen we ook projecten financieren die de energie-efficiëntie verhogen. De Save80-fornuizen, die 80% energie-efficiënter zijn, verminderen de CO2-uitstoot en bieden een enorme gezondheidsboost. <a class=\"link\" href=\"#\"> (Bekijk de andere projecten hier) </a>"},"lang_en_faq":{"faq1_title":"Why installing the Ninja App requires permission to “Read and change all data on websites you visit'?","faq1_text":"For the Ninja App to work properly it needs to have access to the information about the website you are visiting to know if you’re on one of our partners’ sites. In short, the Ninja App downloads the list of partner shops, then works in the background, comparing the website you’re viewing against the downloaded list, and if there is a match, it shows our CO₂ok button. The information about visited websites does not leave your computer, so your privacy is protected. The Ninja App has an open code available at Github so anyone can view and audit it to make sure it is safe to use.","faq2_title":"Does the Ninja App track my purchases or internet activity?","faq2_text":"No! We don’t need your Data to fight climate change and therefore we don’t collect or save any personal shopping data. Our goal is to make the world a better place and not collecting data. We do get information about what kind of products are purchased and how many items are bought each month, but we do not track individual users’ purchases & don’t store them!","faq3_title":"What stores does the Ninja App work with?","faq3_text":"We have partnered with several big e-commerce businesses such as Ebay, Bol.com, Booking.com, CoolBlue, Aliexpress, Etsy, and over 22000 others. See the list of all participating stores.","faq4_title":"How do shops benefit from being in CO₂ok Ninja program?","faq4_text":"Our users are clients who have a strong incentive to buy from our partner shops and not their competition.<br><br>We are preparing multiple new features such as highlighting partners’ websites in search results. These features directly drive new consumers to partners’ stores.<br><br>Thanks to CO₂ok the brands of the shops are associated with a great cause. They show that climate and our environment matters to them as well and with this they boost their image.","faq5_title":"How big is your piece of the cake?","faq5_text":"We invest 75% of the commission in the CO₂ compensation. The remaining 25% are much needed to keep CO₂ok going. We just started and our margin doesn’t even cover the costs. Our goal is to make an impact and give everybody the chance to easily fight climate change. Eventually, we will reduce our margin – we are not in this to become rich. We will always be open and transparent and therefore we will report our income and spending each year.","faq6_title":"I only shop at Amazon and already use Amazon Smile program, is there any reason for me to install the Ninja App?","faq6_text":" First of all, our partners usually donate 2-12 times more through the Ninja App (1-6%) than Amazon does through Amazon Smile (only 0.5% of the final price). So, if you care about having as big a positive impact on the world as you can, using the Ninja App either instead of or in addition to Amazon Smile is a way to achieve that. Moreover, there are a lot of products or services available in our partner stores that are not available on Amazon. For example, travel services (hotels, flights, train tickets, car rentals), financial products, or sport clubs’ official apparel.","faq7_title":"Credits to Altruisto","faq7_text":" We would like to thank Altruisto for putting their code open source so we could fork our own project based on their previous work. Altruisto does a great job at donating to charities through online shoppings. Their GitHub repo can be found here: Altruisto GitHub repository","faq8_title":"Does it cost me anything to use the Ninja App?","faq8_text":"No, the Ninja App is absolutely free to use. The prices in the online stores are exactly the same whether you use the app or not.","faq9_title":"I am not buying in any of these stores, is there any reason for me to install the Ninja App?","faq9_text":"Yes, there are three reasons: <br>1) We are constantly working on new partnerships, so we may partner with stores that you do use in the near future. It’s easier to have it already installed rather than regularly check if stores that you use have been added. <br>2) If you even once decide to buy from our partners stores, having the Ninja App already installed can be a difference with the output of CO₂ in the world. It’s better to have it installed just in case, rather than miss an easy opportunity to do a lot of good for free. <br>3) It is easier to establish new partnerships with a bigger user base: the more users the Ninja App has, the easier it is to convince new stores to join our initiative. Therefore, by installing the Ninja App, you make it more probable that we will partner with shops you use in the future.","faq10_title":"How does it work?","faq10_text":" After installing the Ninja app you will see a our “Shop CO₂ok” box whilst shopping in one of our partner stores. Simply click this box and you will be redirected back to the partner store (exactly where you were before). From then on, whenever you buy something, CO₂ok receives a portion of the price you pay (usually between 1% and 6%). We donate our profits to carefully selected organisations such as Atmosfair. Some stores will require you to repeat the process after some time. You are a mobile Ninja - see here.","faq11_title":"How can I be sure that the money will be used to compensate greenhouse gasses?","faq11_text":"Atmosfair and Fair Climate Fund provide us with certificates to prove we compensated. Additionally, we will report our income and spending each year.","faq12_title":"How does CO2 compensation work?","faq12_text":" Greenhouse gases are emitted during the production and transport of the products you purchase. By investing in products that prevent an equal amount of these greenhouse gases to be emitted, your purchase can be made climate neutral. <a class=\"link\" href=\"#\">(details)</a> So how do you reduce emissions? By financing renewable energy and emission reducing projects, future emissions are prevented: a net reduction. <a class=\"link\" href=\"#\">(details)</a>","faq13_title":"So how do you reduce emissions?","faq13_text":" By financing renewable energy and emission reducing projects, future emissions are prevented: a net reduction. <a class=\"link\" href=\"#\">(details)</a>","faq14_title":"How do you determine the carbon footprint of products?","faq14_text":" We use manufacturer data whenever we can, since this is the most accurate. If the manufacturers don’t know or report this data, we will estimate it, gradually improving our accuracy. <a class=\"link\" href=\"#\">(details)</a>","faq15_title":"Will my entire contribution go to CO2 compensation?","faq15_text":"Initially, 75% of your contribution will go to CO2 compensation through Atmosfair. Our 25% margin will be used to to make CO₂ok sustainable and get all online stores to use our plugin to offer CO2 compensation. Eventually, we will reduce our margin – we are not in this to become rich. We will report our income and spending each year.","faq16_title":"What kind of projects will we finance?","faq16_text":" In addition to renewable energy projects such as solar, wind and hydropower, we will also fund projects that increase energy efficiency. For instance, the Save80 cooking stoves, which are 80% more energy efficient, reduce CO2 emissions and offer a tremendous health boost.<a class=\"link\" href=\"#\">(View the other projects here)</a>"}}

Het is beter om het te hebben geïnstalleerd voor het geval dat, in plaats van een gemakkelijke kans te missen om heel veel gratis te doen. <br> 3) Het is gemakkelijker om nieuwe partnerschappen tot stand te brengen met een groter gebruikersbestand: hoe meer gebruikers de Ninja-app heeft, hoe gemakkelijker het is om nieuwe winkels te overtuigen om deel te nemen aan ons initiatief.

Since October 2018 Lodi and Nick are co-owners of CO2ok. They have a commercial background and wanted to start their own business. They also wanted to use their knowledge for the environment. When they heard about CO2ok they were instantly enthusiastic. They phoned Milo and soon their collaboration was a fact. Milo is responsible for the ideas and the technology and Lodi and Nick for the operational management. Their dream? In five years' time, all products will be produced in a climate-neutral way and compensation for your purchases will no longer be necessary. As a result, CO2ok has become superfluous.",

In short, the Ninja App downloads the list of partner shops, then works in the background, comparing the website you’re viewing against the downloaded list, and if there is a match, it shows our CO₂ok button. The information about visited websites does not leave your computer, so your privacy is protected.

-        'faq4_text': 'Our users are clients who have a strong incentive to buy from our partner shops and not their competition.<br><br>We are preparing multiple new features such as highlighting partners’ websites in search results. These features directly drive new consumers to partners’ stores.<br><br>Thanks to CO₂ok the brands of the shops are associated with a great cause. They show that climate and our environment matters to them as well and with this they boost their image.',

-        'faq5_text': 'We invest 75% of the commission in the CO₂ compensation. The remaining 25% are much needed to keep CO₂ok going. We just started and our margin doesn’t even cover the costs. Our goal is to make an impact and give everybody the chance to easily fight climate change. Eventually, we will reduce our margin – we are not in this to become rich.

So, if you care about having as big a positive impact on the world as you can, using the Ninja App either instead of or in addition to Amazon Smile is a way to achieve that. Moreover, there are a lot of products or services available in our partner stores that are not available on Amazon.

It’s easier to have it already installed rather than regularly check if stores that you use have been added. <br>2) If you even once decide to buy from our partners stores, having the Ninja App already installed can be a difference with the output of CO₂ in the world. It’s better to have it installed just in case, rather than miss an easy opportunity to do a lot of good for free. <br>3) It is easier to establish new partnerships with a bigger user base: the more users the Ninja App has, the easier it is to convince new stores to join our initiative. Therefore, by installing the Ninja App, you make it more probable that we will partner with shops you use in the future.',

Zijn doel? Iedereen in staat te stellen zijn online aankopen klimaatneutraal te doen. Tegelijkertijd wil hij ervoor zorgen dat de levensstandaard van mensen in derdewereldlanden wordt verhoogd. Kortom: een win-winsituatie dus.\n\nSinds oktober 2018 is Jos mede-eigenaar van CO2ok. Jos heeft een commerciële achtergrond en wilde graag voor zichzelf beginnen. Ook wilde hij zijn kennis graag inzetten voor het milieu. Toen hij hoorde over CO2ok was hij direct enthousiast. Hij belde Milo op en al snel was hun samenwerking een feit. Milo is verantwoordelijk voor de ideeën en de techniek en Jos voor de bedrijfsvoering.\n\nHun droom? Over vijf jaar worden alle producten klimaatneutraal geproduceerd en is het compenseren van je aankopen niet meer nodig. Daardoor is CO2ok overbodig geworden.",

-{"lang_nl_faq":{"faq1_title":"Waarom zou het installeren van de Ninja-app toestemming nodig hebben om 'Alle gegevens op websites die je bezoekt' te lezen en te wijzigen?","faq1_text":"Om de Ninja-app goed te laten werken, moet deze toegang hebben tot de informatie wat betreft de website die u bezoekt om te weten of u op een van de sites van onze partners bent. In Kortom, de Ninja-app downloadt de lijst met partnerwinkels en werkt vervolgens in de achtergrond, door de website die u bekijkt te vergelijken met de gedownloade lijst, en als er is een overeenkomst, het toont onze CO₂ok-knop. De informatie over bezocht websites verlaat uw computer niet, dus uw privacy is beschermd. De Ninja-app heeft een open code beschikbaar bij Github, zodat iedereen het kan bekijken en controleren om er zeker van te zijn dat het het is veilig in gebruik.","faq2_title":"Volgt de Ninja-app mijn aankopen of internetactiviteit?","faq2_text":"Nee! We hebben uw gegevens niet nodig om de klimaatverandering te bestrijden en daarom verzamelen of bewaren wij geen persoonlijke winkelgegevens. Ons doel is om de wereld een betere plek te maken en geen gegevens te verzamelen. We krijgen wel informatie over wat voor soort producten worden gekocht en hoeveel items elke maand worden gekocht, maar we houden geen rekening met de aankopen van individuele gebruikers en slaan deze niet op!","faq3_title":"In welke winkels werkt de Ninja-app?","faq3_text":"We zijn een partnerschap aangegaan met verschillende grote e-commercebedrijven zoals Ebay, Bol.com, Booking.com, CoolBlue, AliExpress, Etsy en meer dan 22.000 anderen. Bekijk de lijst met alle deelnemende winkels.","faq4_title":"Hoe profiteren winkels van het CO₂ok Ninja-programma?","faq4_text":"Onze gebruikers zijn klanten die een sterke prikkel hebben om te kopen bij onze partnerwinkels en niet bij hun concurrenten.<br><br>We bereiden meerdere nieuwe functies voor, zoals het markeren van de websites van partners in de zoekresultaten. Deze functies drijven nieuwe consumenten rechtstreeks naar de winkels van partners. <br><br>Dankzij CO₂ok worden de merken van de winkels geassocieerd met een groot doel. Ze laten zien dat het klimaat en onze omgeving ook voor hen van belang zijn en daarmee vergroten ze hun imago.","faq5_title":"Hoe groot is jouw stuk van de taart?","faq5_text":"We investeren 75% van de commissie in de CO₂-vergoeding. De overige 25% is hard nodig om CO₂ok aan de gang te houden. We zijn net begonnen en onze marge dekt niet eens de kosten. Ons doel is om impact te maken en iedereen de kans te bieden om gemakkelijk de klimaatverandering te bestrijden. Uiteindelijk zullen we onze marge verminderen - we zijn niet in deze om rijk te worden. We zullen altijd open en transparant zijn en daarom zullen we elk jaar onze inkomsten en uitgaven rapporteren.","faq6_title":"Ik shop alleen bij Amazon en gebruik al het Amazon Smile-programma. Kan ik de Ninja-app installeren?","faq6_text":"Ten eerste doneren onze partners meestal 2-12 keer meer via de Ninja-app (1-6%) dan Amazon via Amazon Smile (slechts 0,5% van de uiteindelijke prijs). Dus, als je een zo groot mogelijke positieve invloed op de wereld wilt hebben, is het gebruik van de Ninja-app in plaats van of in aanvulling op Amazon Smile een manier om dat te bereiken. Bovendien zijn er veel producten of services beschikbaar in onze partnerwinkels die niet beschikbaar zijn op Amazon. Bijvoorbeeld reisdiensten (hotels, vluchten, treinkaartjes, autoverhuur), financiële producten of officiële kleding van sportclubs.","faq7_title":"Credits voor Altruisto","faq7_text":"We willen Altruisto bedanken voor het open source plaatsen van hun code zodat we ons eigen project kunnen aanvatten op basis van hun eerdere werk. Altruisto doet geweldig werk door te doneren aan goede doelen via online winkelen. Hun GitHub-repo is hier te vinden: de Altruisto GitHub-repository","faq8_title":"Kost het me iets om de Ninja-app te gebruiken?","faq8_text":"Nee, de Ninja-app is absoluut gratis te gebruiken. De prijzen in de online winkels zijn exact hetzelfde, of u de app nu gebruikt of niet.","faq9_title":"Ik koop geen van deze winkels, is er een reden voor mij om de Ninja-app te installeren?","faq9_text":"Ja, er zijn drie redenen: <br>1) We werken voortdurend aan nieuwe partnerschappen, dus we kunnen samenwerken met winkels die u in de nabije toekomst wel gebruikt. Het is eenvoudiger om het al te installeren in plaats van regelmatig te controleren of winkels die u gebruikt, zijn toegevoegd. <br> 2) Als u ooit eens besluit om bij onze partners te kopen, kan het hebben van de Ninja App al een verschil maken met de uitvoer van CO₂ in de wereld. Het is beter om het te hebben geïnstalleerd voor het geval dat, in plaats van een gemakkelijke kans te missen om heel veel gratis te doen. <br> 3) Het is gemakkelijker om nieuwe partnerschappen tot stand te brengen met een groter gebruikersbestand: hoe meer gebruikers de Ninja-app heeft, hoe gemakkelijker het is om nieuwe winkels te overtuigen om deel te nemen aan ons initiatief. Daarom, door de Ninja-app te installeren, maakt u het waarschijnlijker dat we zullen samenwerken met winkels die u in de toekomst gebruikt.","faq10_title":"Hoe werkt het?","faq10_text":"Na het installeren van de Ninja-app ziet u een onze \"Shop CO₂ok\" -doos terwijl u winkelt in een van onze partnerwinkels. Klik eenvoudigweg op dit vakje en u wordt teruggeleid naar de partnerwinkel (precies waar u eerder was). Vanaf dat moment ontvangt CO₂ok, wanneer u iets koopt, een deel van de prijs die u betaalt (meestal tussen 1% en 6%). We doneren onze winst aan zorgvuldig geselecteerde organisaties zoals Atmosfair. In sommige winkels moet u het proces na enige tijd herhalen. Je bent een mobiele Ninja - zie hier.","faq11_title":"Hoe weet ik zeker dat het geld zal worden gebruikt om broeikasgassen te compenseren?","faq11_text":"Atmosfair en Fair Climate Fund verschaffen ons certificaten om te bewijzen dat we hebben gecompenseerd. Daarnaast zullen we elk jaar onze inkomsten en uitgaven rapporteren.","faq12_title":"Hoe werkt CO2-compensatie?","faq12_text":"Broeikasgassen worden uitgestoten tijdens de productie en het transport van de producten die u koopt.

Als de fabrikanten deze gegevens niet kennen of rapporteren, zullen we deze schatten, waardoor onze nauwkeurigheid geleidelijk verbetert. <a class=\"link\" href=\"#\"> (details) </a>","faq15_title":"Gaat mijn hele bijdrage naar CO2-compensatie?","faq15_text":"Aanvankelijk gaat 75% van uw bijdrage naar CO2-compensatie via Atmosfair.

Uiteindelijk zullen we onze marge verminderen - we zijn niet in deze om rijk te worden. We rapporteren elk jaar onze inkomsten en uitgaven.","faq16_title":"Wat voor soort projecten zullen we financieren?","faq16_text":"Naast projecten op het gebied van hernieuwbare energie, zoals zonne-, wind- en waterkracht, zullen we ook projecten financieren die de energie-efficiëntie verhogen. De Save80-fornuizen, die 80% energie-efficiënter zijn, verminderen de CO2-uitstoot en bieden een enorme gezondheidsboost. <a class=\"link\" href=\"#\"> (Bekijk de andere projecten hier) </a>"},"lang_en_faq":{"faq1_title":"Why installing the Ninja App requires permission to “Read and change all data on websites you visit'?","faq1_text":"For the Ninja App to work properly it needs to have access to the information about the website you are visiting to know if you’re on one of our partners’ sites. In short, the Ninja App downloads the list of partner shops, then works in the background, comparing the website you’re viewing against the downloaded list, and if there is a match, it shows our CO₂ok button. The information about visited websites does not leave your computer, so your privacy is protected. The Ninja App has an open code available at Github so anyone can view and audit it to make sure it is safe to use.","faq2_title":"Does the Ninja App track my purchases or internet activity?","faq2_text":"No! We don’t need your Data to fight climate change and therefore we don’t collect or save any personal shopping data. Our goal is to make the world a better place and not collecting data. We do get information about what kind of products are purchased and how many items are bought each month, but we do not track individual users’ purchases & don’t store them!","faq3_title":"What stores does the Ninja App work with?","faq3_text":"We have partnered with several big e-commerce businesses such as Ebay, Bol.com, Booking.com, CoolBlue, Aliexpress, Etsy, and over 22000 others. See the list of all participating stores.","faq4_title":"How do shops benefit from being in CO₂ok Ninja program?","faq4_text":"Our users are clients who have a strong incentive to buy from our partner shops and not their competition.<br><br>We are preparing multiple new features such as highlighting partners’ websites in search results. These features directly drive new consumers to partners’ stores.<br><br>Thanks to CO₂ok the brands of the shops are associated with a great cause. They show that climate and our environment matters to them as well and with this they boost their image.","faq5_title":"How big is your piece of the cake?","faq5_text":"We invest 75% of the commission in the CO₂ compensation. The remaining 25% are much needed to keep CO₂ok going. We just started and our margin doesn’t even cover the costs. Our goal is to make an impact and give everybody the chance to easily fight climate change. Eventually, we will reduce our margin – we are not in this to become rich. We will always be open and transparent and therefore we will report our income and spending each year.","faq6_title":"I only shop at Amazon and already use Amazon Smile program, is there any reason for me to install the Ninja App?","faq6_text":" First of all, our partners usually donate 2-12 times more through the Ninja App (1-6%) than Amazon does through Amazon Smile (only 0.5% of the final price). So, if you care about having as big a positive impact on the world as you can, using the Ninja App either instead of or in addition to Amazon Smile is a way to achieve that. Moreover, there are a lot of products or services available in our partner stores that are not available on Amazon. For example, travel services (hotels, flights, train tickets, car rentals), financial products, or sport clubs’ official apparel.","faq7_title":"Credits to Altruisto","faq7_text":" We would like to thank Altruisto for putting their code open source so we could fork our own project based on their previous work. Altruisto does a great job at donating to charities through online shoppings. Their GitHub repo can be found here: Altruisto GitHub repository","faq8_title":"Does it cost me anything to use the Ninja App?","faq8_text":"No, the Ninja App is absolutely free to use. The prices in the online stores are exactly the same whether you use the app or not.","faq9_title":"I am not buying in any of these stores, is there any reason for me to install the Ninja App?","faq9_text":"Yes, there are three reasons: <br>1) We are constantly working on new partnerships, so we may partner with stores that you do use in the near future. It’s easier to have it already installed rather than regularly check if stores that you use have been added. <br>2) If you even once decide to buy from our partners stores, having the Ninja App already installed can be a difference with the output of CO₂ in the world. It’s better to have it installed just in case, rather than miss an easy opportunity to do a lot of good for free. <br>3) It is easier to establish new partnerships with a bigger user base: the more users the Ninja App has, the easier it is to convince new stores to join our initiative. Therefore, by installing the Ninja App, you make it more probable that we will partner with shops you use in the future.","faq10_title":"How does it work?","faq10_text":" After installing the Ninja app you will see a our “Shop CO₂ok” box whilst shopping in one of our partner stores. Simply click this box and you will be redirected back to the partner store (exactly where you were before). From then on, whenever you buy something, CO₂ok receives a portion of the price you pay (usually between 1% and 6%). We donate our profits to carefully selected organisations such as Atmosfair. Some stores will require you to repeat the process after some time. You are a mobile Ninja - see here.","faq11_title":"How can I be sure that the money will be used to compensate greenhouse gasses?","faq11_text":"Atmosfair and Fair Climate Fund provide us with certificates to prove we compensated. Additionally, we will report our income and spending each year.","faq12_title":"How does CO2 compensation work?","faq12_text":" Greenhouse gases are emitted during the production and transport of the products you purchase. By investing in products that prevent an equal amount of these greenhouse gases to be emitted, your purchase can be made climate neutral. <a class=\"link\" href=\"#\">(details)</a> So how do you reduce emissions? By financing renewable energy and emission reducing projects, future emissions are prevented: a net reduction. <a class=\"link\" href=\"#\">(details)</a>","faq13_title":"So how do you reduce emissions?","faq13_text":" By financing renewable energy and emission reducing projects, future emissions are prevented: a net reduction. <a class=\"link\" href=\"#\">(details)</a>","faq14_title":"How do you determine the carbon footprint of products?","faq14_text":" We use manufacturer data whenever we can, since this is the most accurate. If the manufacturers don’t know or report this data, we will estimate it, gradually improving our accuracy. <a class=\"link\" href=\"#\">(details)</a>","faq15_title":"Will my entire contribution go to CO2 compensation?","faq15_text":"Initially, 75% of your contribution will go to CO2 compensation through Atmosfair. Our 25% margin will be used to to make CO₂ok sustainable and get all online stores to use our plugin to offer CO2 compensation. Eventually, we will reduce our margin – we are not in this to become rich. We will report our income and spending each year.","faq16_title":"What kind of projects will we finance?","faq16_text":" In addition to renewable energy projects such as solar, wind and hydropower, we will also fund projects that increase energy efficiency. For instance, the Save80 cooking stoves, which are 80% more energy efficient, reduce CO2 emissions and offer a tremendous health boost.<a class=\"link\" href=\"#\">(View the other projects here)</a>"}}
